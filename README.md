# About the Open Ireland Network

Open Ireland Network is a network for organizations and individuals on the island of Ireland who want to connect around Open Source Software, Open Hardware, Open Data, Open Research, Open Government and all things open.
## About the Learning Resources Project


This project aims to compile a comprehensive collection of learning materials centered around open source and InnerSource, specifically tailored for Irish IT professionals and developers. We envision this collection as a dynamic resource, welcoming and encouraging everyone to add and share links and information. Our ultimate goal is to foster continuous learning and skill enhancement within the Irish community
